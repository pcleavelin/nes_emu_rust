## An NES emulator built entirely in rust
This, eventually, will be a simple bare-bones Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. It will not be an exact emulation of the system, as this project is just a learning exercise for myself.

Feel free to take the code and add things to it or improve it. Just make sure to provide a link to here if you distribute it c:
